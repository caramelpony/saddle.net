Saddle Network offers colocation services for your servers in our data center racks. 
We have a variety of options available starting from 1U all the way up to full racks.

See below for our current pricing and options.

## Colocation Pricing

Colocation pricing is based on the amount of rack space you need and the power requirements of your servers.
The following table outlines our current colocation pricing for rack space.

***Note**: These prices are in USD and are only reflective of our typical pricing scheme. Final costs may vary depending on your chosen PoP if the cost of providing service at that location is higher than average.*

| Service | Price | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1U Rack Space | $75/month | 1U of rack space |
| 2U Rack Space | $130/month | 2U of rack space |
| 4U Rack Space | $225/month | 4U of rack space |
| 1/4 Rack | $420/month | 10U of rack space  |
| 1/2 Rack | $800/month | 20U of rack space  |
| Full Rack | Contact Us | 42U of rack space |

### Power Pricing

All power is billed according to the host data center's pricing.
In order to get an accurate esimate, please contact us with your power requirements.

## Provider Cost Sharing
If you're a service provider looking to cut down on costs when establishing a new PoP, we can help!
We are always looking for new partners to help us expand our network and we are happy to share the costs of establishing a new PoP with you.

### If we come to you
We're open to solicitations from service providers looking to establish a new PoP in an area we are not currently in.
If you have a location in mind and a quote from both a data center and a transit provider, we may be willing to share the costs of establishing a new PoP with you in exchange for a split of the total rack space and power.

### You come to Us
On occasion, we may have locations that we are still in the process of establishing a PoP in. If you represent a service provider and are interested in sharing the costs of establishing a new PoP at that location, please contact us with your proposal.
