## Current Points of Presence

Saddle Network strives to maintain globally dispersed points of presence with a focus on areas of interest, customer demand, and expansion opportunity.

Our Points of Presence (PoPs) are categorized by region and type. Each PoP is classified as one of the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Full | More than half of a full rack of capacity |
| Half | Half or less of a full rack of capacity |
| Colo | Single server colocated with another provider |
| Virt | Virtual server hosted by another provider |
| Mixed | Multiple locations of different types |

Below you will find a table of the current Points of Presence, along with additional information.

## Future Exotic Points of Presence
Saddle Network remains dedicated to pushing the boundaries of network infrastructure, ensuring connectivity in even the most remote and unconventional locations.

Looking ahead, Saddle Network has ambitious plans to explore unconventional and extreme environments for potential PoPs. These initiatives are in early-stage research and feasibility assessments:
