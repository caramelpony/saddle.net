## Current Points of Presence

Saddle Network strives to maintain globally dispersed points of presence with a focus on areas of interest, customer demand, and expansion opportunity.

Our Points of Presence (PoPs) are categorized by region and type. Each PoP is classified as one of the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Full | More than half of a full rack of capacity |
| Half | Half or less of a full rack of capacity |
| Colo | Single server colocated with another provider |
| Virt | Virtual server hosted by another provider |
| Mixed | Multiple locations of different types |

Below you will find a table of the current Points of Presence, along with additional information.
