**Why do we call this network ICANN?**
*The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) and its regional registries, such as ARIN, RIPE, and others, are responsible for the global coordination of IP address allocation in what we generally call the "Internet". IANA operates under the authority and on behalf of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN).*
