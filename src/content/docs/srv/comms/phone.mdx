We maintain a proprietary and internal numbering plan for a private phone system. This numbering plan is invite only and is not publicly accessible. 

### 12 Digit Variable Length Numbering Plan

The numbering plan is designed to match our internal needs and is based on the following format:
| 12 Digit Variable Length Numbering Plan | | | |
| Tier Code | Sub Code | Assignee Prefix | Subscriber Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 digits  | 2 digits | 3 digits | Remaining Digits | 
| N | XX | XXX | See Below |


Where `X` is a digit from 0 to 9 and `N` is a digit from 2 to 9. 

The first digit of the tier code must be a number from 2 to 9, as tier codes `0` and `1` are reserved for administration's proprietary use.

### Variable Subscriber Blocks 

In the above numbering format, the remaining 6 digits for the subscriber number may not always be assigned in whole to one provider.

For example, providers may request 10, 100, 1000 or 10000 number blocks for allocation.

Providers are assigned a "Prefix", a fixed sequence of digits infront of the digits that would make up their numbering block.

So for example: 
| Prefix ||
| --- | --- |
| 1-23-456-12345X | We own anything 0 - 9 on the digit X |

#### Prefix Sizes Available

| Prefix | Numbers Available | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-23-456-XXXXX | 10 Numbers | 0 - 9 |
| 1-23-456-XXXX | 100 Numbers | 00 - 99 |
| 1-23-456-XXX | 1,000 Numbers | 000 - 999 |
| 1-23-456-XX | 10,000 Numbers | 0000 - 9999 |

We do maintain larger blocks for allocation if the provider intends to sub-assign a significant portion of the space.

| Prefix | Numbers Available | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-23-456-X | 100,000 Numbers | 00000 - 99999 |
| 1-23-456 | 1,000,000 Numbers | 000000 - 999999 |
