We maintain a proprietary and internal numbering plan for a private phone system. This numbering plan is invite only and is not publicly accessible. 

The numbering plan is designed to be similar to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and is based on the following format:

| Tier Code | Sub Code | Subscriber Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 digits  | 2 digits | 7 digits          | 
| NXX | XXX | XXXX |


Where `X` is a digit from 0 to 9 and `N` is a digit from 2 to 9. 

The first digit of the tier code must be a number from 2 to 9, as tier codes `0` and `1` are reserved for administration's proprietary use.

Below is a list of the tier codes and their usecases:

| Tier Code | Usecase | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Reserved for utility codes | [↩](/srv/comms/phone/0) |
| 1 | Reserved for administration's proprietary use | [↩](/srv/comms/phone/1) |
