Saddle Network provides a matrix service for our users to communicate with each other and with our services. This service is limited and registration must be approved by an administrator.

### Matrix Service

Our Matrix server uses [Conduwuit](https://conduwuit.puppyirl.gay/), a fork of [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/), and is hosted in our [Chicago, IL](/infra/pops/na-central/us-chi-1) location.
