Saddle Network provides a matrix service for our users to communicate with each other and with our services. This service is limited and registration must be approved by an administrator.

### Matrix Service

Our Matrix server uses [Tuwunel](https://github.com/matrix-construct/tuwunel), a continuation of [Conduwuit](https://girlboss.ceo/~strawberry/conduwuit.txt), and fork of [Conduit](https://conduit.rs/), and is hosted in our [Denver, CO](/infra/pops/na-west/us-den-1) location.
