description: An internal email system for Saddle Network.
---
Our email system is split into three parts, each with their own purpose and usecases

First we have an [internal email system](/infra/local-mail) that is used for internal communication. This is a private system for communicating locally within our network.


Second, we have an [external email system](/infra/stalwart) that is used for communication with the outside world. 
This system is accessible to the public and is used for contacting customers, partners, and other external parties.
This system is also used by our services to send notifications and alerts to users.

Third is our [public hosted email system](/srv/comms/email).
This system is accessible to the public and is used for hosting email accounts for our users. **This is the system this page is referring to.**

#### Public Hosted Email System

Currently, this service is only available to users we have invited to use it.

All email accounts are hosted on our servers and are accessible via the web interface or through email clients using standard protocols such as IMAP and SMTP.

For our web interface, we offer two options: SquirrelMail and Roundcube.
Both options are available to all users and can be accessed through the email portal.
