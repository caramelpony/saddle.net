Saddle Network maintains an anycast Linux mirror service for use in its network operations and for public use.

Currently, our mirror only operates within Amsterdam, Netherlands. We plan on expanding to other locations in the future.

Below you will find a table of distributions, the versions we mirror, and any excluded packages.

We limit our supported architectures to **x86**, **x86_64**, **aarch64**, and **riscv64**.
