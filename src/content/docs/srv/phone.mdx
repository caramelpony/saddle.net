description: A proprietary and internal numbering plan for a private phone system.
---

We maintain a proprietary and internal numbering plan for a private phone system. This numbering plan is invite only and is not publicly accessible. 

The numbering plan is designed to be similar to the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) and is based on the following format:

| Tier Code | Sub Code | Subscriber Number |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 digits  | 2 digits | 7 digits          | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| NXX | XXX | XXXX |


Where `X` is a digit from 0 to 9 and `N` is a digit from 2 to 9. 
The first digit of the area code and the first digit of the exchange code must be a number from 2 to 9. The second digit of the area code and the second digit of the exchange code must be a number from 0 to 9. The last four digits of the phone number can be any combination of digits from 0 to 9.
